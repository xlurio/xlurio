# Hi There!

I'm Lucas Calegario, self taught and entusiast developer since adolescence, trying to start my career in IT. Focus on REST APIs development. Proeficient on several technologies as Python, Django, FastAPI, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, among others.


## What Can I Offer You?

Besides a cup of tea, there's the [RobinWould](https://github.com/xlurio/robinwould)(aha). RobinWould is framework for fast and easy development on web scraping tools based. With less than 10 lines of code you already have script ready to fish for data on the web.

Also, there's the [Herodotus](https://github.com/xlurio/herodotus), a simple package for fastening the integration between Scrapy spiders and SQLAlchemy. With a few lines, it easily allows the data to be stored as soon as it gets scraped, providing a faster development for scraping tools.

Last but not less important, the [HerbertistAPI](https://github.com/xlurio/hebertist-api) (I'm a history person, judge me) is a REST API for comparing prices of games between multiple virtual game stores for mere peasant like us who enjoy buying games with good deals.
