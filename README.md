# Hi There!

I'm Lucas Calegario, self taught and entusiast developer since adolescence, trying to start my career in IT. Focus on REST APIs development. Proeficient on several technologies as Python, Django, FastAPI, Docker, SQL, PostgreSQL, among others.


## What Can I Offer You?

Besides a cup of tea, there's the [RobinWould](https://github.com/xlurio/robinwould)(aha). RobinWould is a framework that allows fast and easy developing on scraping tools.

Also, there's the [Herodotus](https://github.com/xlurio/herodotus) is a package for fastening the integration between Scrapy spiders and SQLAlchemy, providing a faster development on scraping tools.

Last but not less important, the [HerbertistAPI](https://github.com/xlurio/hebertist-api) (I'm a history person, judge me) is a REST API for comparing prices of games between multiple virtual game stores for mere peasant like us who enjoy buying games with good deals.
