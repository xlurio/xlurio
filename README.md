# Hi There!

I'm Lucas Calegario, an entusiastic and self taught backend developer trying to start my career on technology. The language I have more experience with is Python, but I'm currently adventuring my self on C# since it received support for Linux.


## What Am I Up To?

Right now I'm building a Python package for fast integration between Scrapy spiders and SQLAlchemy models. If you want to check out or contribute, you can find it [here](https://github.com/xlurio/herodotus).

I'm also building a REST API for managing accounts on paid services that are shared between a group so it become easier to manage the payments. If you want to check out or contribute, you can find it [here](https://github.com/xlurio/joint-account-manager-api).


## What Can I Offer You?

Besides a cup of tea, you could check the [HerbertistAPI](https://github.com/xlurio/hebertist-api) (I'm a history person, judge me). The HerbertistAPI is a REST API for comparing prices of games between multiple virtual game stores for mere peasant like us who enjoy buying games with good deals.
